```
- Install [Python-3.12.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3129/). Newer verions may work as well.

- [Optional] Set up a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts.
    - Open command prompt (Windows)
    - Navigate to the project folder: `cd \path\to\spam-detection`
    - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv myvenv` 
    - Activate the virtual environment: `myvenv\Scripts\activate`

- Install required Python modules: `pip install -r \path\to\requirements.txt`


# Set up parameters

- Ensure that `parameters.xlsx` exists in the `config` folder. This file should contain four sheets:

## Sheet 1: `filepaths`
Specifies paths for files and folder. This sheet contains three columns:

- `parameter`: Variable names used to refer specific file or folder. 
    > **WARNING**: Do not modify this column.

- `value`: Path of corresponding `parameter`. The `value` for the `data_file` parameter must be changed to the survey data filepath.

- `description`: Description of corresponding `parameter`.

## Sheet 2: `flags`
Contains details of flags used for automated fraud detection. Each row specifies one flag. This sheet contains six columns:

- `flag_name`: Name of the flag. We recommend using the convention `F_FlagName`.

- `method_name` Name of the method used. Must match the method name implemented in `fraud_detection.py`. See `docs` for more details.

- `flag_group`: Name of the flag group. We recommend using the convention `FG_FlagGroupName`.

- `use_flag`: Indicator for using the flag (`1`) or not (`0`). 

- `parameters`: Flag-specific paramters that are required by the corresponding method. See `docs` for more details.

- `description`: A brief description of the flag. Optional.

## Sheet 3: `initial_classification_rules`
Contains a sequence of top-down rules to classify responses based on flag groups. Once a rule is satisfied, the response is assigned the corresponding classification, and no subsequent rules are evaluated. This sheet contains four columns:

- `rule_num`: Rule number. Optional.

- `condition_expr`: An expression for the Boolean condition using flag groups. The expression is evaluated using Python's [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval). The evaluation of the expression must return either `True` or `False`.

- `classification`: Response classification label.

- `use_rule`: Indicator for using the rule (`1`) or not (`0`).

## Sheet 4: `final_classification_rules`
Contains a sequence of top-down rules to classify responses combining automated and manual classification. Once a rule is satisfied, the response is assigned the corresponding classification, and no subsequent rules are evaluated. This sheet contains four columns:

- `rule_num`: Rule number. Optional.

- `condition_expr`: An expression for the Boolean condition using `FLAG` and `MANUAL_FLAG` columns. The expression is evaluated using Python's [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval). The evaluation of the expression must return either `True` or `False`.

- `classification`: Response classification label.

- `use_rule`: Indicator for using the rule (`1`) or not (`0`).

# Fraud detection
Although fraud detection can be implemented by double-clicking Python files. We highly recommend to use command prompt to exectue the file. 

## Step 1: Initial classification
Execute `01_initial_classification.py` to generate an output file with automated response classification. 

The output file path is the value of `flagged_file` in the `filepaths` sheet of `parameters.xlsx`. The output file will contain:

- The original survey data columns.

- Columns corresponding to each flag indicating TRUE or FLASE. Some additional columns corresponding to specific methods may also be created.

- Columns corresponding to each flag group with the number of corresponding flags activated.

- The automated response classification column `FLAG`.

- Placeholder columns for manual classification by the user `MANUAL_FLAG` and `MANUAL_COMMENT`.


## Step 2: Get descriptive statistics and generate plots (Optional)
Execute `02_get_initial_descriptives.py` to print descriptive statistics (such as counts) for the flags and flag groups and to generate co-occurence plots for diagnostic purposes. 

- If provided, the plots are saved in the `figure_folder` folder provided in the `filepaths` sheet of `parameters.xlsx`. 

## Step 3: Manual classification
This step involves user to manually classify the responses, especially the ones marked as `TBD` in the `FLAG` column during automated classification. 

Manual classification can be done in the `flagged_file` itself. However, a `manual_file` path can be set in the `filepaths` sheet of `parameters.xlsx` if the file is copied before manual classification.

- The `MANUAL_FLAG` entered by the user are used to evaluate the `condition_expr` in the `final_classification_rules` sheet of `parameters.xlsx`. 

- `MANUAL_COMMENT` is an optional column to add information justfying the manual classification.

## Step 4: Final classification
Execute `04_final_classification.py` to generate an output file that combines automated and manual classifications.

The output file path is the value of `final_output_file` in the `filepaths` sheet of `parameters.xlsx`. The output file will contain:

- All columns in `manual_file`.

- A final classification column `FINAL_FLAG`.

## Step 5: Get descriptive statistics and generate plots (Optional)
Execute `05_get_final_descriptives.py` to print descriptive statistics (such as counts) for the flags and flag groups and to generate co-occurence plots for diagnostic purposes. 

- If provided, the plots are saved in the `figure_folder` folder provided in the `filepaths` sheet of `parameters.xlsx`.
